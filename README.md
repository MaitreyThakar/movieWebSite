# movieWebSite
this is made by me and my 1 friend by using html, js, css, and php for backend.

to run it create folder name: movieWebSite
and add this files in it -> .DS_Store
                        ->bollywood.php
                        ->contactus.php
                        ->dholywood.php
                        ->hollywood.php
                        ->index.php
                        ->play.php
                        ->script.js
                        ->style.css
                        ->tollywood.php
and create other folder in 'movieWebSite' name: components
and add this file in it ->.DS_Store
                        ->footer.php
                        ->left-navigation.php
                        ->right-navigation.php
                        ->top-navigation.php

                        we are doing this because we give specific path to all files
